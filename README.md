# SeeFood App [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/IbrahimNM/seefood_app.svg?token=Z7DztJ4D33ytYAbsRtvx&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/IbrahimNM/seefood_app)

# Before launching the Application
## Permissions
To verify that the application has the permission to **write on the device storage** and to use the **camera**.
1. **Goto** *Setting -> Apps
2. **Locate** the *seefood* application.
3. **Goto** the permission section for the application.
4. **Give** the application a permission to Storage.
5. **Give** the application a permission to Camera.

> currently, the seefood app needs these permission to functions. On the future this issue will be resolved.
